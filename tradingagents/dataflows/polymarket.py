"""Polymarket prediction-market vendor.

Surfaces live, market-implied probabilities for forward-looking events (Fed
decisions, recession, elections, geopolitics, crypto) to the news analyst, as a
complement to news (what happened) and FRED macro data (where things stand):
what the crowd actually prices to happen next.

Uses Polymarket's public Gamma API (https://gamma-api.polymarket.com) — no key,
no auth. Each market's ``outcomePrices`` are the implied probabilities of its
outcomes (a "Yes" at 0.76 means the market prices a 76% chance).
